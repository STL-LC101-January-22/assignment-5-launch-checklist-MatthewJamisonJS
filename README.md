assignment-5-launch-checklist-MatthewJamisonJS created by GitHub Classroom

Using my knowledge of forms, the DOM, and HTTP, we were asked to create a quick launch checklist. We have four fields that take user information: the pilot's name, the co-pilot's name, the fuel levels, and the mass of the cargo.

This project uses a function [preventDefault()] to prevent a request from being sent out and the page reloading.

It also to ensures the following:

The user entered something for every field.
The user entered text for names and numbers for fuel and cargo levels.
With validation, the code updated a list of what was currently ready or not ready for the shuttle launch.

I indicated what is good or bad about the shuttle and whether it is ready for launch by using the DOM to update the CSS.
I fetched some planetary JSON to update the mission destination with vital facts and figures about where the shuttle is headed.

Before this project could be considered, it had to pass all of the "AutoGrader Tests"
